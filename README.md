## Tools for simple mortgage calculations

* Tool 1: mortgage length calculator. This Python 3.6 tool calculates the length of a mortgage based on a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly repayments. Note that the interest rate is compounded monthly in this tool.

* Tool 2: mortgage schedule. This R 3.4 script calculates the length of a mortgage based on a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly repayments. The interest is compounded daily, and repayments are assumed to be made at the end of the month. The script also produces a full repayment schedule with details on the amounts of interest and principal repaid every month.
