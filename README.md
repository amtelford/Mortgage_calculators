## Tools for simple mortgage calculations

* Tool 1: mortgage length calculator. This tool calculates the length of a mortgage based on a fixed interest rate and fixed monthly repayments. Note that the interest rate is compounded monthly. The difference between this (simpler) method and using a daily compounded interest is minimal, and doesn;t affect the result in any practical example.
